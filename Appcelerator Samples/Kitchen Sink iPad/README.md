# Titanium Mobile - The Kitchen Sink iPad

This project includes a wide variety of the APIs available in Titanium Mobile.  For more,
head out to the [Appcelerator Developer Center](http://developer.appcelerator.com).

# NOTE TO VIEWERS
Using one JavaScript file per window in an application, while occasionally useful, is not considered a best practice.  It is done in the Kitchen Sink so we can have a "clean slate" for every API demo.  In a real application, you would probably use many fewer execution contexts, probably just the root context defined by app.js - for a demo of this approach in a more "real life" app, check out [Tweetanium](http://github.com/appcelerator/Tweetanium).

# WINDOWS USERS

Please place the Kitchen Sink demo in your user folder or a similarly shallow directory - windows' command line file path lengths cause problems with our build scripts.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

If the Kitchen Sink doesn't work out of the box for you, please [follow these steps outlined on our community Q&A](http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/53821/kitchen-sink-wont-run-what-do-i-do).
