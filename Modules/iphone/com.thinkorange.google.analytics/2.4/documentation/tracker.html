<h2>Tracker</h2>
<p>Google Analytics tracking interface. You can optain a reference to a tracker
using this:</p>
<pre><code>var Tracker = GoogleAnalytics.tracker;
</code></pre>
<h2>Reference</h2>
<h3>Tracker.trackView(page)</h3>
<p>Track that the specified view or screen was displayed. This call sets the
appScreen property and generates tracking information to be sent to Google
Analytics.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Tracker.trackView('MainViewController');
</code></pre>
<h3>Tracker.trackEvent({...})</h3>
<p>Tracks an event. For more information about Event tracking refer to the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/eventTrackerGuide.html">Event
Tracking
Guide</a>.
It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>category</em> [required]: the event name</li>
<li><em>action</em> [required]: the action name</li>
<li><em>label</em> [required]: a label for the event</li>
<li><em>value</em> [optional]: an optional integer value</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Tracker.trackEvent({
  category: 'Videos',
  action  : 'play',
  label   : 'Baby\'s First Birthday'
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this scenario, the reports for Events would display Videos as the Category,
Play as the Action, and Baby's First Birthday as the Label.</p>
<h3>Tracker.trackTiming({...})</h3>
<p>Tracks user timing. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>category</em> [required]: A string representing a timing category</li>
<li><em>time</em> [required]: A timing value (integer)</li>
<li><em>name</em>: A string representing a timing name, or <code>null</code> if none.</li>
<li><em>label</em>: A String representing a timing variable label, or <code>null</code> if none.</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Tracker.trackTiming({
  category: 'Videos',
  time: 123
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Tracker.trackSocial({...})</h3>
<p>Track social action. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>network</em> [required]: A string representing social network</li>
<li><em>action</em> [required]: A string representing a social action</li>
<li><em>target</em>: A string representing the target</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Tracker.trackSocial({
  network: 'Facebook',
  action: 'share'
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Tracker.trackException({...})</h3>
<p>Track an exception. It accepts the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>isFatal</em> [required]: A boolean indicating whether the exception is fatal</li>
<li><em>description</em> [required]: A description of the error</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>Tracker.trackException({
  isFatal: false,
  description: "No more space left"
});
</code></pre>
<h3>Tracker.trackTransaction(transactionProxy)</h3>
<p>Tracks a transaction. For more information about the object you should pass
here, see the <a href="transaction.html">transaction documentation</a></p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<h3>Tracker.getCustomVariable(name)</h3>
<p>Get a tracking parameter. The param is the name of the tracking paramenter.</p>
<h3>Tracker.setCustomVariable(name, value)</h3>
<p>Set a tracking parameter. Both params are strings.</p>
<h3>Tracker.setCustomDimension(index, dimension)</h3>
<p>Sets a custom dimension. Index is a integer, value is a String.</p>
<h3>Tracker.setCustomMetric(index, metric)</h3>
<p>Sets a custom metric. Index is a integer, metric could be a 64-bit number.</p>
<h3>Tracker.appName | Tracker.setAppName(name)</h3>
<p>The application name associated with this tracker. By default, this property is
populated with the <code>CFBundleName</code> string from the application bundle. If you
wish to override this property, you must do so before making any tracking
calls.</p>
<h3>Tracker.appID | Tracker.setAppID(appID)</h3>
<p>The application identifier associated with this tracker. This should be set to
the iTunes Connect application identifier assigned to your application. By
default, this property is <code>null</code>. If you wish to set this property, you must do
so before making any tracking calls.</p>
<p>Note that this is not your app's bundle id (e.g. com.example.appname), but the
identifier used by the App Store.</p>
<h3>Tracker.appVersion | Tracker.setAppVersion(version)</h3>
<p>The application version associated with this tracker. By default, this property
is populated with the <code>CFBundleShortVersionString</code> string from the application
bundle. If you wish to override this property, you must do so before making any
tracking calls.</p>
<h3>Tracker.anonymize | Tracker.setAnonymize(boolean)</h3>
<p>Tracking data collected while this is <code>true</code> will be anonymized by the Google
Analytics servers by zeroing out some of the least significant bits of the IP
address. By default, this flag is <code>false</code>.</p>
<h3>Tracker.useHTTPS | Tracker.setUseHTTPS(boolean)</h3>
<p>Tracking information collected while this is true will be submitted to Google
Analytics using HTTPS connection(s); otherwise, HTTP will be used. Note that
there may be additional overhead when sending data using HTTPS in terms of
processing costs and/or battery consumption.</p>
<h3>Tracker.sampleRate | Tracker.setSampleRate(rate)</h3>
<p>The sampleRate parameter controls the probability that the visitor will be
sampled. By default, sampleRate is 100, which signifies no sampling. sampleRate
may be set to any value between 0 and 100, inclusive. A value of 90 means 90%
of visitors should be sampled (10% of visitors to be sampled out).</p>
<p>When a visitor is not sampled, no data is collected by Google Analytics for iOS
library about that visitor's activity. If your application is subject to heavy
traffic spikes, you may wish to adjust the sample rate to ensure uninterrupted
report tracking. Sampling in Google Analytics occurs consistently across unique
visitors, ensuring integrity in trending and reporting even when sampling is
enabled, because unique visitors remain included or excluded from the sample,
as set from the initiation of sampling.</p>
<h3>Tracker.clientID</h3>
<p>The client ID for the tracker. This is a persistent unique identifier generated
the first time the library is called and persisted unchanged thereafter. It is
used to identify the client across multiple application sessions.</p>
<h3>Tracker.appScreen | Tracker.setAppScreen(appScreen)</h3>
<p>The current screen set for this tracker.</p>
<p>Calling trackView: will also update this property before it dispatches tracking
information to Google Analytics. However, if you wish to update the current
screen without sending any tracking information, set this property directly.
The updated screen will be reflected in subsequent tracking information.</p>
<h3>Tracker.referrerURL | Tracker.setReferrerURL(url)</h3>
<p>The referrer URL for this tracker. Changing this value causes it to be sent
with the next dispatch of tracking information.</p>
<h3>Tracker.campaignURL | Tracker.setCampaignURL(url)</h3>
<p>The campaign URL for this tracker. This is not directly propagated to Google
Analytics, but if there are campaign parameter(s), either manually or
auto-tagged, present in this URL, the SDK will include those parameters in the
next dispatch of tracking information. Google Analytics treats tracking
information with differing campaign information as part of separate sessions.</p>
<h3>Tracker.sessionStart</h3>
<p>If true, indicates the start of a new session. Note that when a tracker is
first instantiated, this is initialized to true. To prevent this default
behavior, set this to <code>false</code> when the tracker is first obtained.</p>
<p>By itself, setting this does not send any data. If this is true, when the next
tracking call is made, a parameter will be added to the resulting tracking
information indicating that it is the start of a session, and this flag will
be cleared.</p>
<h3>Tracker.sessionTimeout | Tracker.setSessionTimeout(timeout)</h3>
<p>If non-negative, indicates how long, in seconds, the application must
transition to the inactive or background state for before the tracker will
automatically indicate the start of a new session when the app becomes active
again by setting sessionStart to true. For example, if this is set to 30
seconds, and the user receives a phone call that lasts for 45 seconds while
using the app, upon returning to the app, the sessionStart parameter will be
set to true. If the phone call instead lasted 10 seconds, sessionStart will not
be modified.</p>
<p>To disable automatic session tracking, set this to a negative value. To
indicate the start of a session anytime the app becomes inactive or
backgrounded, set this to zero. By default, this is 30 seconds.</p>
