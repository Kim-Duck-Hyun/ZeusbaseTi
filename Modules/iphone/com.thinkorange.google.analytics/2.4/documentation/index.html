<h1>google_analytics Module</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>The Google Analytics for Mobile Apps SDK for iOS makes it easy to implement
Google Analytics in an iOS-based applications. This document describes how to
integrate the SDK with your apps.</p>
<p>The Google Analytics for Mobile Apps SDKs provide an interface for tracking
activity within mobile apps and reporting that activity to Google Analytics.
For example you can use this SDK to calculate visits, session length, bounce
rate and unique visitors. Tracking mobile applications has some structural
variations from tracking website pages.</p>
<h2>Accessing the google_analytics Module</h2>
<p>To access this module from JavaScript, you would do the following:</p>
<pre><code>var GoogleAnalytics = require("com.0x82.google.analytics");
</code></pre>
<p>The GoogleAnalytics variable is a reference to the Module object.   </p>
<h2>Reference</h2>
<p>The first thing you do is to configure the global Google Analytics module.
You do that by setting the following properties:</p>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.accountID [string]</h3>
<p>The tracking ID (a string that begins with "UA-"). Must not be <code>null</code> or empty.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>GoogleAnalytics.accountID = "UA-2061857-2";
</code></pre>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.debug [boolean]</h3>
<p>If <code>true</code>, Google Analytics debug messages will be logged to output. This is
useful for debugging calls to the Google Analytics SDK.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>GoogleAnalytics.debug = true;
</code></pre>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.optOut [boolean]</h3>
<p>When this is <code>true</code>, no tracking information will be gathered; tracking calls
will effectively become no-ops. When set to <code>true</code>, all tracking information
that has not yet been submitted. The value of this flag will be persisted
automatically by the SDK.  Developers can optionally use this flag to implement
an opt-out setting in the app to allows users to opt out of Google Analytics
tracking.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>GoogleAnalytics.optOut = true;
</code></pre>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.dispatchInterval [integer]</h3>
<p>If this value is negative, tracking information must be sent manually by
calling dispatch. If this value is zero, tracking information will
automatically be sent as soon as possible (usually immediately if the device
has Internet connectivity). If this value is positive, tracking information
will be automatically dispatched every dispatchInterval seconds. Default value
is 120.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>GoogleAnalytics.dispatchInterval = 120;
</code></pre>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.trackUncaughtExceptions [boolean]</h3>
<p>When set to <code>true</code>, the SDK will record the currently registered uncaught
exception handler, and then register an uncaught exception handler which tracks
the exceptions that occurred using the default tracker.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>GoogleAnalytics.trackUncaughtExceptions = true;
</code></pre>
<h2>Creating a tracker</h2>
<p>After setting the values before, you can create your tracker:</p>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.tracker</h3>
<p>Returns a tracker associated with the specified tracking ID. The tracker can be
used to send tracking data to Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>var Tracker = GoogleAnalytics.tracker;
</code></pre>
<p>For more information about what you can do with the Tracker, see the
provided <a href="tracker.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h3>GoogleAnalytics.dispatch()</h3>
<p>Forces the dispatcher to send pending information to Google, instead of waiting
for <code>dispatchSeconds</code> seconds.</p>
<h2>Additional info</h2>
<p>Before you begin using the SDK, you must first create a free account at
<code>www.google.com/analytics</code> and create a new website profile in that account using
a fake but descriptive website URL (e.g. <code>http://mymobileapp.mywebsite.com</code>).
Once you create the profile, write down or keep a copy of the web property ID
that is generated for the newly-created profile.</p>
<p>A Web property ID is also known as the UA number of your tracking code and
looks like <code>UA-xxxxx-yy</code>, where the x's and y's indicate the unique numbers for
your profile. You must indicate the web property ID you'd like to use when
instantiating the tracking object. </p>
<p>You must indicate to your users, either in the application itself or in your
terms of service, that you reserve the right to anonymously track and report a
user's activity inside of your app. Your use of the Google Analytics SDK is
additionally governed by the Google Analytics Terms of Service, which you must
agree to when signing up for an account.</p>
